# NodeAdv_Blogs
This is a simple (MERN) Blogs app where a user signup/signin using Google OAuth to simply create and view his/her blogs. The main goal behind this project was to
make use of Redis to implement query caching, have a scalable data storage (for images in this case) using Amazon S3 service, use Pupeteer and Jest for 
automated headless browser testing and implement CI/CD using travis and extensively make use of cookies and sessions throught the project.


I made this to showcase my strengths in certain crucial aspects of web dev in Nodejs applications. 

This project has only been made to show the best of my skills for my job-seeking purposes and is not allowed to anyone for any kind of use but only to view.
Hence, this has been written in a particularly suitable manner.
